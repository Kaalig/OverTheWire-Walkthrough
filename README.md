# OverTheWire-Walkthrough

## Introduction

Here's a quick write-up of the OverTheWire bandit wargame (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). All levels will be included. For those that don't want to be spoiled, I will give few hints before digging deep into the level.
Also, don't forget to create a password file containing all the passwords you fought. It's a hassle to go back at level 0 when you were level 10 because your PC shut down for example.


### Level 0
Level Goal :
*The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.*

So first of all, we will be using SSH in order to connect to the host on port 2220. Here's the command line :
IMAGE BANDIT0

In order to connect to a SSH we use this topology : username@IP_ADRESS or username@DOMAIN_NAME. Since they gave us the username, domain name and also the password, we can confidently write it like this : bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org . If you don't specify the port, it will automatically try to connect to the 22 port and it will give us an error. This is why -p 2220 is important. Lastly, don't forget to invoke sudo.

If it worked, you should see this. Simply type the password they gave us : 
IMAGE BANDIT0_1

This will lead us to be on the bandit0 machine, which should be like this :
IMAGE BANDIT0_2

Bravo ! You completed your first bandit level !
